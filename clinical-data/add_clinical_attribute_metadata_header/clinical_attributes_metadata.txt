Having multiple copies of a gene means that the tumor's DNA has many consecutive repetitions of the region that codes for a given gene. Having multiple extra copies of a gene is also described as an amplification, while losing copies of a gene is described as a deletion.	PATH CEP17 Copy	1				
BXHER2_COPY	SAMPLE	STRING	Copy number of HER2 in the pathology report. This is the number of copies of the HER2 gene seen in the sample, which is used to calculate the HER2/CEP17 ratio.

GLEASON_SCORE	SAMPLE	STRING	The score derived from universally embraced prostate cancer grading system developed by Dr. Donald F. Gleason in 1977. The system provides a reproducible description of the glandular architecture of prostate tissue to which a pathologist assigns a score depending primarily on the microscopic patterns of cancerous glands and cell morphology. The system correlates well with behavior at the extremes: Gleason 1+1 tumors are the most well differentiated, slowly growing and rarely spread; Gleason 4+5 tumors are the most poorly differentiated, often widely metastatic at the time of diagnosis. In the commoner intermediate grade tumors, however, behavior is extremely variable.	Radical Prostatectomy Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer	1
